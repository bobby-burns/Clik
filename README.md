## Contribute

This game is in the very early stage, Pre-Alpha, and can get any contribution I can get. I am not an experienced programmer at all and would love any help I can get. Contribution priority is what I'm looking for help (in order) at the current time.

### Contribution Priority:
1. Main Gameplay (features, code in general)
2. Optimization
3. Documentation
