A guitar hero like game created as a side project by Bobby burns

Current Version: Pre-Alpha 00.1

:warning:**WARNING! This Version is in Pre-Alpha, the game is in no way finished and is VERY buggy** :warning:

## Contribute

This game is in the very early stage, Pre-Alpha, and can get any contribution I can get. I am not an experienced programmer at all and would love any help I can get. Contribution priority is what I'm looking for help (in order) at the current time.

### Contribution Priority:
1. Main Gameplay (features, code in general)
2. Optimization
3. Documentation


## How to contribute
There are two ways to edit the source and compile to test.

### Using Eclipse IDE (easiest)
* Install and open Eclipse
	* *Make sure you have the JDK*
* Clone the repo and put it somewhere you will remember
* In Eclipse, go to *File >> Open Project From File System* and set the directory to the cloned repo
	* Make sure you import the **Clik-master** folder after unzipping
* You can now edit and build the source, to make a pull request, press *CTRL + SHIFT + 3* to start the staging processes.


## Using seperate IDE
To use another IDE, import the java files from *Clik/src/clik* and add the **core.jar** file from the *Clik* folder as a library. You can then use javac to compile
